# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free and positive experience for everyone participating in this project and its community. Below, you'll find our expectations for participant behavior and the steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We expect all contributors to abide by this Code of Conduct in all project spaces - online as well as in person. The tone should be warm, friendly, inclusive, and professional.

## Our Community Standards

We are committed to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, inviting, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Showing empathy and compassion to others.
* Being respectful of different opinions, views, and experiences.
* Giving and receiving constructive criticism graciously.
* Taking responsibility and apologizing to those who suffered because of our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
* It means focusing our attention on what is best, not just for ourselves as individuals, but for the community in general.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
* Anything that resembles trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal/ political attacks.
* Harassment in public or private.
* Publishing other people's private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
* Any other conduct which might be considered inappropriate for the workplace.

## Reporting Guidelines (How Contributors Can Report Issues)

If you witness or are made aware of unacceptable behavior or have other concerns, please report them as soon as possible.

**In case of misconduct, please contact project maintainers via:**

**conduct@my-awesome-project.org**

*OR*

**codeofconduct@githubusername.com**

All complaints are reviewed, investigated as soon as possible, and given fair treatment. All community leaders have the responsibility to maintain the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Responsibilities for Enforcement

The project team and maintainers have the right and responsibility to clarify the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Enforcement Directives

Community leaders will use these guidelines in deciding how to act when a Code of Conduct violation is reported:

1.  **Correction:** For inappropriate conduct, the community leaders may privately give a written warning.
2.  **Warning:** In cases of continual or repeated improper behavior, a warning without interaction for a certain period of time may be given.
3.  **Temporary Ban:** In serious cases, a temporary ban on any kind of interaction or public communication with the project will be issued.
4.  **Permanent Ban:** Permanent bans are issued when there is sustained harassment or clearly hostile behavior.
